## Initial Response 

As the IT Help Desk Support employee I greeted the user and acknowledge the request, since the user was newly onboarded, in the image down below you can see that the IT employee noted that they would need supervisor approval would be required before they can have access to the both drives

## ✅ Supervisor Approval & PC Name

- The IT Technician ( in this case its me) has communicated with the users supervisor , this is an important step as we now know they have permission to access these files and folders
- Also the PC Name was given to then have access to remote into that users computer , and was added as an internal note
- Internal note added: PC NAME IS ---> DESKTOP2
- Internal note is used for future references if I need to look back at the ticket this note wil be their ( only other IT Techs can see this )

## 📁 Creating the Shared Drives

Using Server Manager on the DC ---> Server2022: 

1. Navigated to File and Storage Services > Shares

2. Created two new shares:

   - \\Server2022\Personal
   - \\Server2022\Finance

## Configuring Security Groups

In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC):

- Created two security groups:

  - Personal

  - Finance

You would also do the same process for the Finance security group and add bruce wayne as a memeber to that security group as well

## 🔐 Setting NTFS Permissions

- On the Personal share folder (C:\Shares\Personal), permissions were set to allow:

    - Modify access for Helpdesk, so the helpdesk technician , in this case me can have access to it from the helpdesk desktop instead of having to use the DC 

    - Modify access for Personal security group , which is the group where we added the user bwayne into
 
    - You would also do the same thing for the Finance shared folder, but instead add the finance secuiryt group to it

## Mapping the Drive

In Bruce Wayne’s profile settings (ADUC):

- Mapped a Z: drive to \\Server2022\Personal\bwayne

Now the next time he logs in he will have access to his personal drive 


As for the finance drive  you would map it differenctly, you would need to connect remotely and created it from his PC , BY going to this PC ---> Map network drive and then type in \\Server2022\Finance --> and map it to the A: drive
