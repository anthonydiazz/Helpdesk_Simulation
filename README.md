## Initial Response 

As the IT Help Desk Support employee I greeted the user and acknowledge the request, since the user was newly onboarded, in the iamage down below you can see that the IT employee noted that they would need supervisor approval would be required before they can have access to the both drives

## ✅ Supervisor Approval & PC Name

- The IT Technician ( in this case its me) has communicated with the users supervisor , this is an important step as we now know they have permission to access these files and folders
- Also the PC Name was given to then have access to remote into that users computer , and was added as an internal note
- Internal note added: PC NAME IS ---> DESKTOP2
- Internal note is used for future references if I need to look back at the ticket this note wil be their ( only other IT Techs can see this )
